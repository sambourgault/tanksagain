## Description

They look like toys but they shoot bullets like machine guns. They look armless but they have infinite munitions. What are they? What do they hide inside their playful shell?

Knowledge on individuals and masses emerge from the study of their environmental context. Therefore through camera, light, sound and object, this experimentation strive to understand better the tank entity as a being of the virtual world.


## History

*Tanks! again...* is based on Pippin Barr's original idea of using the classic Unity tutorial [*Tanks!*](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/tanks-tutorial) to create new iterations by the exploration of formal elements of the game engine: camera & lights, sound and 3D objects. My game gathers therefore three small projects that focus on each of these elements.

 *Introspection* or exploration on Camera and Light: I began this prototype with a very formal approach: trying to put myself in place of the camera, see where and how the camera could result into a meaningful experience. By doing so I realized that from these technical experimentations would result a narrative exhibiting the tank as a sentient being with believes and history of its own. The work is divided in five little scenes that get in touch with the inner side and the spirituality of a tank.

*Instruction* or exploration on Sound: This prototype is a series of two scenes: the prelude and the opera. My design process for this game was inspired by the sound experimentation of artists such as Steve Reich, Brian Eno and Philip Glass. The first one can be scene as a remake of Music for Airport by Eno. And the second one as a free interpretation of Einstein on the Beach by Glass. This prototype strives to reveal how the abnormal use of functional elements of the game engine can create unexpected experience.

*Discussion* or exploration on 3D Objects: This one is completely different from the others. I wanted to create a conversation game where you interact with pieces of tank reassembled together to create strange humanoid creatures. The discussion turns around the concreteness and the freedom of being a tank in this virtual world. This discourse is deliberately in opposition with the actual free will of the player that is practically inexistent. At the end, the player is confronted with real photo taken from the news: the war in Syria, the conflict in Crimea, the face of Justin Trudeau.. etc. The idea here is to create a parallel between this sinister world of tanks and the player's reality.
